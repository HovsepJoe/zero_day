**My First repository project via my local computer** 
In my local machine, I configured my basic info (name, email) for Git, as they were associated with my commits.

On GitHub.com, I created a new repository named "zero_day" using the graphic interface. It was set as a public repository with the description "This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer," and I left out the README, .gitignore, or license.

On my computer, I opened the terminal and navigated to my home directory. Then, I created a new directory called "zero_day" and navigated into it.

I initialized Git in this directory and added the remote origin (the GitHub repository I had just created).

Using a command-line editor like Emacs, I created a README.md file and wrote a small Markdown text to present my project. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes formatting easy.

Next, I added the README.md file to Git, committed the changes with the message "My first commit," and pushed it to the remote server (GitHub). I needed to provide my login/password to authenticate the push.

By following these steps, I had my first repository on GitHub, with my project's README.md file added and committed using Git. This set the foundation for version control and collaboration on my project.oii
